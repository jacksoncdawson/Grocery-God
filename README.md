## Overview
Grocery God is a tool designed to streamline grocery shopping by collecting and analyzing data from various stores. The project features a web app for logging grocery purchases, a scraper for collecting weekly deals from Safeway, and a data cleaning process to ensure the data is ready for analysis. All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Supabase.

## Current Features
